## Intro

This repo is still a work in progress. Currently, we have following projects. This is a generic repo where few datascience problems have initial experimentation setup already available for start. To avoid ``Copyright`` issues authours are not uploading any datasets but posting the links from where the datasets can be obtaned. 

<br/>
